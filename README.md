Factuality Module 
==================

This module is developed for the NewsReade project[1] and aims to classify whether statements in a text are factual (have happened or haven't happened), probable, possible or underspecified. 

To train the classifier, data from FactBank v1 was used [2] and WEKA 3.6.9 [3] to generate a model for machine learning. 

See WORKFLOW.sh for the order of the commands.
